## Chat App

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

Chat App is a native chat app for mobile devices developed using **Expo**, **Google Firestore Database** (to store the chat messages) and the **Gifted Chat library**. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share *images* and their *location*. Chat App is optimized for both *Android* and *iOS* devices because the **React Native** framework allows developing native apps with only one codebase.

### About
More and more people use their phones for daily tasks, such as shopping, creating to-do lists, communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, and more. That's why many companies offer native mobile versions of their web apps, or even skip creating a web app entirely.

In the past, building high-quality mobile apps required a lot of time and money because writing apps for different platforms like iOS and Android required specialized programmers who could build and maintain multiple codebases.

Over time, however, new technologies emerged that made it easier for companies to build and maintain mobile applications using familiar syntax. One of these technologies is React Native, a framework for building Android and iOS apps that only requires one codebase.

### Features
- Users can enter their name and select a background color for their chat screen before beginning to chat.
- A page displays the user's conversation and allows them to continue the conversation with an input field and submit button.
- In addition to sending text, users can send images and their location.
- Data is stored both online and offline.

### Development
To run this project you need to install Node.js and Expo. You can choose if you would like to have Android and iOS emulators, although it is not strictly necessary. I used **Android Studio** and my own iPhone with Expo Go App.

`npm install expo-cli --global`

Install the application's dependencies in the project directory using:
`npm install`

To run the project, use:
`expo start`

In the future I intend improve the UI to make it even more attractive and easy to use. I would also like to get deeper on the possibilities that this combination of technologies offer to further improve the app.

### Usage
Please let me know if you would like to use this project as a template to create your own. I'll be happy to get in touch and help with whatever you need.
